title: Photovoltaic GIS Research Project
---

* I worked in a team of two for several months on a research project to map and analyze New Jerseyâ€™s photovoltaic potential using Python and the ArcGIS software suite.
* For the project, I acquired data from several large companies (SEIA, Sunrun, and NREL) and analyzed it using a custom collection of Python script tools for geographic information systems (GIS).
* Upon completion, we presented the findings and final poster at a state-wide contest, and took second place for the Best Data Integration Category.
* Due to the success, the project was later presented at the 2014 Esri User Conference in San Diego.
