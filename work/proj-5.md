title: Anonymous Infographic
---

* I conducted extensive research about the Anonymous collective.
* To present the findings, I completed a research paper, and an infographic.
* Following nomination by my professor, the infographic and paper were considered
as finalists for the McPartlin Award.
* The infographic was also published by Fresh Writing, which selects a handful of
excellent research projects by first year students.
