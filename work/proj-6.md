title: ACE Technical Intern
---

* While an intern, I worked with a small team to maintain and update the ACE website, the CREO website, and ACEâ€™s Client Relations Database.
* I also developed a responsive web template for the Joomla platform with a small team for ACE affiliated websites.
* This was a particularly valuable experience because I collaborated with several designers and other computer scientists to develop, design, and build school websites for the ACE Academies.
