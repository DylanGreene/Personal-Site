title: C++ Image Compression Project
---

* Final Project for Fundamentals of Computing II: C++ Implementation of a File Compression Algorithm
* This project was inspired by the desire to really do something unique and to learn a lot.
* Image compression was decided upon because my partner and I valued how important data
compression is, yet we knew next to nothing about it.
* While, the project did not end up working fully do to time constraints, the general objectives
of the project were successful in that we were able to convert color spaces, perform a discrete cosine transform, and quantize the images.
* Overall, it was an extremely valuable experience. I learned a lot and look forward to applying the knowledge I gained in future projects.
