* With another resident, I built a new website for the dorm in order to post relevant dorm events and keep the community informed.
* I also worked on SEO to get this new site better search results than the old site (which was still up on a different domain).
* Currently, I maintain the site as one of the two site Administrators by updating it with new content when necessary.
