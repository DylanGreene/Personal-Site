title: Web Development
---

* While not a primary interest of mine at this point in time, I do enjoy occasionally working
on web development.
* I have built several sites in the past using content management systems such as WordPress and Joomla.
* I have also used tools such as Materialize to help with a uniform design.
* This site is built using the static site generator Jekyll.
* I consider myself to be rather knowledgeable regarding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
* Further, following previously working alongside graphic designers, I am certainly interested
in implementing modern and clean user interfaces. I hope this site fits that description!
