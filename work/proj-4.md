* As a part of the modern digital age, I am proud to be the 2006 Time Magazine Person of the Year.
* Considering how the Web has become a tool for, as Time Magazine put it, "bringing together the small contributions of millions of people and making them mater", I hope to use this tool to make major contributions and better communities worldwide.
