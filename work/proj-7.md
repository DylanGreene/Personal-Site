title: Project Euler
---

* I love solving Project Euler problems. They are challenging and really require me
to think critically to implement solutions.
* I usually solve the problems using Java.
* To date, I have solved 62 problems, and I look forward to solving many more.
* Some of the achievements I have acquired on the site include: Decathlete, Flawless Fifty, and Trinary Triumph, among others.
